# ember-cli-template-lint

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rwjblue/ember-cli-template-lint.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rwjblue/ember-cli-template-lint)

ember-cli-template-lint will lint your templates and add a test for each asserting
that all style rules have been satisfied.

For example, given the rule `bare-strings` is enabled, this template would be
in violation:

```hbs
{{! app/components/my-thing/template.hbs }}
<div>A bare string</div>
```

Thus a the test `TemplateLint: app/components/my-thing/template.hbs` would
fail with the assertion "A bare string was found (0:5)".

## Install

To install ember-cli-template-lint

```
ember install ember-cli-template-lint
```

__Ember CLI >= 2.4.2 is required for linting templates__

## Configuration

ember-cli-template-lint is powered by [ember-template-lint](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-template-lint)
which allows configuration by using a `.template-lintrc.js` file in the root of your project.

See [here](https://github.com/rwjblue/ember-template-lint/#rules) details on configuration and rules that are available.

## Contributing

A few ideas for where to take this in the future:

* The list of rules should be configurable
* This addon should use a test printer shared with jshint, eslint and jscs addons
* A command-line version of the linter should be provided so IDEs and editors
  can provide feedback to devs during development

## Troubleshooting

If your files aren't linted make sure that you don't have the following option set in your `ember-cli-build.js`:
```
var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
  hinting: false
});
```
